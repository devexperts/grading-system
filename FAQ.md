### How to use T-shirts? How can it be used for the non-regular activities like pre-sale and architecture decisions?
The T-shirt measurement system, same as the entire Grading System, does not have rigid meanings. 
T-shirts indicate the frequency/amount of action performed from XS - “never/very little” to XL - “often/very much”. 
N/A means "not applicable/never". For non-regular activities it’s ok to estimate it relatively.

### How to evaluate T-shirt for “Behavior to avoid” section?
When evaluating “Behavior to avoid”, T-shirt sizes also mean from XS - “never/very little” to XL “often/very much”. 
N/A means "not applicable/never". It's recommended to avoid any values starting from M and above in the "Behavior to avoid" section as it can be considered a blocker.
The desired situation is to have only N/A and XS.

### How facts can be collected and validated to evaluate performance?
A wide range of sources could and should be used to collect and validate facts on performance, for example: a "360-degree feedback", metrics from different tools (Jira, Velocity etc.), training certificates, feedback from relevant colleagues, etc. 

### Is programming language certification required to get a particular grade?
There are no mandatory certification requirements. However, any programming language certification can be included into a personal development plan.


## :key: Grading System and Unique projects

### Each project/team is unique. Some of the items may have much more weight for a particular team. Can I make this amendment myself and note that this or that is important given the team/project specific?
Yes. The Grading System does not have rigid meanings, it is intended to indicate general guidelines that need to be used, considering the team/project specifics.

### What if not all the Grading System criteria are applicable to our project?
There are necessary criteria for each level which are applicable for each project. 
All other criteria are up to you and your manager, for those not applicable you can use N/A.
There is an “Other” field to describe all specifics you want.

### Can the Grading System be changed?

### What if all my team members after the grading turned out to be Seniors / Juniors?
This means that either the system has been incorrectly applied or it contains serious flaws. 
Contact the Head of Competency about such cases.

### What if the developer is very modest and filling out the assessment for themselves, will not qualify for the grade they actually deserve?
The company places great importance on ensuring that employees' impact is assessed accurately and fairly. It's the responsibility of the manager to align the developer's grade with their real achievements.
