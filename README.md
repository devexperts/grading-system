# Engineering Grading System at Devexperts

In [Devexperts](https://devexperts.com/), we created the Grading System which:

- Synchronizes engineering grades across the company,
- Makes career levels transparent,
- Specifies our expectations from engineering managers and individual contributors (engineers).

There are [7 grade levels for Engineers (E1 - E7)](Levels_Engineers) and [3 grade levels for Engineering Managers(EM1 - EM3)](Levels_Engineering_Managers).
These tracks are not dead ends. There are various career development options that are too custom to be put into the system.

**For Engineering Grades**, there are the following main sections:
- Overview and regular tasks (the most important part) â€“ "What do I usually do?",
- Am I doing good? - "What is my progress towards the next grade?",
- Technical skills - "Does my tech knowledge comply with this grade?",
- Behavior to pursue - "What are my soft skills?",
- Behavior to avoid -  "What I'd better not do?"
- Extras - "What are my English level, nice-to-have skills, and activities?"


**For Engineering Managers' Grades**, there are the following main sections:
- Overview and regular tasks (the most important part) - "What is my level of responsibility?",
- People management - "How do I work with people inside and outside my team?",
- Project / Product development - "What is my impact?"
- Knowledge sharing - "How did I organize the knowledge exchange inside and outside the team?"
- English language level

## Basic Principles

- Prove your skills first to get an upgrade.
- Your hard skills set does not guarantee your level upgrade. Your impact on the project plays a much bigger role.
- Different levels require different balances between skills.
- No level downgrades.
- It's an Employee's responsibility to showcase their achievements.
- The best upgrade is the one that's evident to everyone.
- Levels are cumulative. Each subsequent level incorporates the previous ones.
- Ideally, the grading documentation should be reviewed more than once a year through recurrent one-on-ones.
