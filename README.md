# Engineering Grading System at Devexperts

In [Devexperts](https://devexperts.com/), we use the Grading System which:

- Synchronizes engineering grades across the company,
- Makes career levels transparent,
- Specifies our expectations from engineering managers and individual contributors (engineers).


## Here are some basic principles we follow

- While having a strong set of hard skills is important, we also consider the impact you have on projects when deciding on level upgrades.
- Each level requires a different balance of skills, so it's important to keep growing and developing in your role.
- We encourage employees to demonstrate their skills and achievements to earn an upgrade.
- We believe in maintaining your current level and not downgrading your position.
- As an employee, it's your responsibility to showcase your accomplishments and contributions to the team.
- We value upgrades that are visible and recognized by everyone.
- Each level builds upon the previous one, creating a cumulative experience.
- To ensure that everyone’s progress is accurately tracked, we recommend regularly reviewing grading documentation through one-on-one meetings, ideally more than once a year.


## The levels we use

There are [7 grade levels for Engineers (E1 - E7)](Levels_Engineers/engineers-profile.md) and [3 grade levels for Engineering Managers(EM1 - EM3)](Levels_Engineering_Managers/engineering-managers-profile.md):
