# Engineering Grading System at Devexperts

In [Devexperts](https://devexperts.com/), we use the Grading System which:

- Synchronizes engineering grades across the company,
- Makes career levels transparent,
- Specifies our expectations from engineering managers and individual contributors (engineers).


## Here are some basic principles we follow

- Prove your skills first to get an upgrade.
- Your hard skills set does not guarantee your level upgrade. Your impact on the project plays a much bigger role.
- Different levels require different balances between skills.
- No level downgrades.
- It's an Employee's responsibility to showcase their achievements.
- The best upgrade is the one that's evident to everyone.
- Levels are cumulative. Each subsequent level incorporates the previous ones.
- Ideally, the grading documentation should be reviewed more than once a year through recurrent one-on-ones.

## The levels we use

There are [7 grade levels for Engineers (E1 - E7)](Levels_Engineers/engineers-profile.md) and [3 grade levels for Engineering Managers(EM1 - EM3)](Levels_Engineering_Managers/engineering-managers-profile.md):

These tracks are not dead ends. We offer a range of customized career development options to help you achieve your goals.
