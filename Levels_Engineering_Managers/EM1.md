# EM1

## Overview 
I lead the activities of my team, with guidance from my manager, towards the execution of well-defined project goals.


## People Management / Working with People
- I am responsible for team members' professional growth, goal setting, empowerment, and evaluation e.g. PPRs, one-on-ones, 360 feedback according to the corporate standards and recommendations.
- I find a common language and communicate with different people, I can convey my point of view.
- I facilitate decision-making discussions in my team.
- I decide on the technical fit and grade of the candidate, providing feedback in a timely manner at each step of the recruitment cycle.
- I am responsible for the onboarding of new team members to the project.
- I make final decisions on newcomers' probation periods.


## Project / Product Development
- I am responsible for hitting deadlines and scope with appropriate quality for each milestone.
- I set up team processes so that the team can be left on its own for some reasonable time (a couple of weeks) and work will not collapse.
- I set goals, prioritize and distribute tasks within the team.
- I check Team's reports in Team Leads Metrics and work on the improvement of the tasks' assessment based on it.
- I facilitate the team activities (scheduling, daily statuses, demos, retrospectives).
- I assess and mitigate risks in the scope of my team/project.

## Knowledge Sharing

- I organize regular verbal knowledge sharing (technical minutes) in the team.
- I participate in events as a speaker.


## :no_entry: Behavior to avoid

- I/we have done our part, it's somebody else's fault.
- Arrogance.
- I push tasks back to my manager.
- I regularly fail to fulfil my commitments.
