# Grading System for Engineers

**For Engineering Grades**, there are the following main sections:
- Overview and regular tasks (the most important part) â€“ "What do I usually do?",
- Am I doing good? - "What is my progress towards the next grade?",
- Technical skills - "Does my tech knowledge comply with this grade?",
- Behavior to pursue - "What are my soft skills?",
- Behavior to avoid -  "What I'd better not do?"
- Extras - "What are my English level, nice-to-have skills, and activities?"
